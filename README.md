# Submission-for-T331199-and-T331200
This repository is my submission for the task #T331199 and task #T331200.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this repository I have submitted the files that doc that I wrote as a submission for the task #T331199 and task #T331200.<br>
In task #T331199 we were supposed to read <a href ="https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2015.1072791"> Graham, Straumann, Hogan. 2015. “Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.”</a> and write our own summary. Along with the summary we were also supposed to give a list of hypothesis and informed guesses based on our reading of the paper.<br>
In task #T331200 we were supposed to do a very light systematic review of, reading through the results of searches which we think might be of help in our research and then read the abstracts of any articles that looked relevant. Though not mentioned in the task I have also attached a really short summary of the papers.
